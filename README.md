## Style TODOs

- [x] Strip out unnecessary JS / CSS for math and stuff
  - ~~Maybe will want to override the head block~~

- Try some different styling
  - [x] fonts
  - [x] colors (light + dark)
- Fix navbar weird spacing
  - [x] ~~Remove `#toggler` from separator should do, or disable JS somehow~~
    Ended up just overriding the style instead.
  - [x] Adjust asymmetrical nav bar separator
  - [x] Still looks kinda bad when expanded on mobile, and hover acts weird
- [x] Decide separate `/about` page or nah?
