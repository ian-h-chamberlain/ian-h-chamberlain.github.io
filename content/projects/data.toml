A game I made in nine days for [Bevy Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3)
(theme: "side effects") with the [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org).

The objective of the game is to push each colored block back into place inside
the cube --- but doing so cause have unwanted side effects. Once all the blocks
are in place, the difficulty will increase and the next level begins.

In this game, you seek to rediscover the lost

the night sky. Later, you can draw the same shapes to cast those spells.
Blast apart the incoming asteroids to protect your planet!
