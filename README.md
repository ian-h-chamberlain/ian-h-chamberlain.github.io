# Personal website

## Themes  to consider

### Resume focused / heavily featured

- [ataraxia](https://www.getzola.org/themes/ataraxia-zola/)
- [kodama](https://www.getzola.org/themes/kodama-theme/) (no JS, kinda boring tho)
- [sam](https://www.getzola.org/themes/sam/) (very minimal, not my fave)
- [resume](https://www.getzola.org/themes/resume/) (needs some restyling and feels kinda slideshowy)
- [hephaestus](https://www.getzola.org/themes/hephaestus/) (could probably use some restyling)

### Photo centric

- [boring](https://www.getzola.org/themes/boring)
- [zplit](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zplit/)

### More blog focused but maybe could work

- [serene](https://www.getzola.org/themes/serene/)
- [papaya](https://www.getzola.org/themes/papaya/)
- [d3c3nt](https://www.getzola.org/themes/d3c3nt/)

### Cool but a lot / overkill / whatever

- [zola.386](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-386/)
- [polymathic](https://www.getzola.org/themes/polymathic/)
