## Themes  to consider

### Resume focused / heavily featured

- [ataraxia](https://www.getzola.org/themes/ataraxia-zola/)
- ~~[kodama](https://www.getzola.org/themes/kodama-theme/) (no JS, kinda boring tho)~~
- ~~[sam](https://www.getzola.org/themes/sam/) (very minimal, not my fave)~~
- [resume](https://www.getzola.org/themes/resume/) (needs some restyling and feels kinda slideshowy)
  - Still consider as maybe
- ~~[hephaestus](https://www.getzola.org/themes/hephaestus/) (could probably use some restyling)~~
  - 3rd party CSS framework that looks hard to customize

### Photo centric

- ~~[boring](https://www.getzola.org/themes/boring)~~
- ~~[zplit](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zplit/)~~

### More blog focused but maybe could work

- [serene](https://www.getzola.org/themes/serene/)
  - Seems like a strong contender, has light and dark themes
  - A couple external JS/CSS libraries, but only for extra features: comments, KaTeX, Mermaid
- [papaya](https://www.getzola.org/themes/papaya/)
- [d3c3nt](https://www.getzola.org/themes/d3c3nt/)

### Cool but a lot / overkill / whatever

- [zola.386](https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-386/)
- [polymathic](https://www.getzola.org/themes/polymathic/)

## Theme TODOs

- [x] Strip out unnecessary JS / CSS for math and stuff
  - ~~Maybe will want to override the head block~~
  - Actually seems like this stuff is already not present if not needed
- [ ] Maybe try some different colors /
- Fix navbar weird spacing
  - [x] ~~Remove `#toggler` from separator should do, or disable JS somehow~~
    Ended up just overriding the style instead.
  - [x] Adjust asymmetrical nav bar separator
- [ ] Decide separate about page or nah? I think yes
