# About me

Hi! I'm Ian, a software engineer living in Seattle.

I've been hacking around on computers since I was pretty young, as well as playing
computer/video games. As a kid, my interest in programming was sparked by my uncle
when he bought me a copy of _Game Programming for Teens_ by Maneesh Sethi.
From then on, I was dead-set on pursuing a career in computer science and game
development to learn the skills I would need to eventually create games of my own.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing games (of course), snowboarding, and
playing [ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)).
I've discovered that my love of hacking and endless customization in open-source
development and homebrew software also translates into homebrewing beer!
